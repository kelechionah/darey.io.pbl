At this point after my verification, i ran my public IP on a browser to test how my installed nginx server will respond to request from the internet

I installed mysql to be able to store and manage data for my site

Log into the mysql by running the sudo mysql command; This command will connect to mysql server as an administrative database user 'root'. 
it is recommended that you run a security script that comes pre-installed with mysql.

Next is to run 'sudo mysql_secure_installation' which is to configure my validate password plugins. answer yes to the prompt questions and type in a strong 
password for mysql root user. When you are done, test if you are able to log into mysql console by running sudo mysql -p as seen below. to exit mysql console,
type mysql> exit

Install php by running the command as seen in the image
<img width="865" alt="lemp 9" src="https://github.com/kelechionah/darey.io.pbl/assets/140612288/e182307a-31f8-4d87-9e07-dc630e60af1f">

Yayyyy. Its time to configure nginx using php processor. We start by creating the root web directory. Next assign ownership of the directory
with the $USER environment variable. Then open a new configuration file in nginx sites-availbale. See corresponding commands in the image below;
<img width="520" alt="lemp 10" src="https://github.com/kelechionah/darey.io.pbl/assets/140612288/84195a7f-0ba4-4735-8c90-35078e7ccb4a">

Type in the following bare bone configurations in the blank page that will appear after the nano command

Activate your configuration by linking to the config file from the nginx sites-enabled
<img width="587" alt="lemp 12" src="https://github.com/kelechionah/darey.io.pbl/assets/140612288/822ec1c2-25b0-492d-a3da-c7d2ee173f57">

Test for syntax errors by running sudo nginx -t command. Disable default nginx host that is currently configured to listen on port 80, 
and then afterwards reload nginxs to apply changes. Next is to creat an index.html file in that location so that we can test that the new server works. 
Please check all the commands in the below image corresponding to my explanations;
<img width="952" alt="lemp 13" src="https://github.com/kelechionah/darey.io.pbl/assets/140612288/78326620-2962-49d5-b011-09b5b4afdcdf">

Now go to your browser and run your public IP and watch the new created index.html file show.

Now its time to test php with nginx. use the command nano /var/www/projectLEMP/info.php  In the new file, type in a valid php code that will return 
info about your server. the valid code is 
<?php
phpinfo();
After this, on your broswer, run your pulic IP /info.php and get this below page
<img width="864" alt="lemp 15" src="https://github.com/kelechionah/darey.io.pbl/assets/140612288/f6417337-8dde-46b2-8830-ef813b6d8fe3">

The next is the retrieve data from mysql database with php. firstly connect to mysql console with sudo mysql -p and create a new database.
Now you create a new user and password and grant him full priveleges on the database. Next is to confirm if the new user has the proper permission by logging into
the mysql console again, this time, using the customer credentials. This can be acheived by running mysql -u example_user -p  
Again by running the command mysql> SHOW DATABASES it'll show the output in the image

Next, creat a test table following the commands in this image. when you confirm that you have valid data in your test table, you can exit mysql console by 
mysql> exit

Use your preferred editor to create a php file in your custom web root directory nano /var/www/projectLEMP/todo_list.php  
Type in the following content as seen in this image below. Save and exit.

run you public IP /todo_list.php in your browser and this page showing the content of your to do list should come up.
